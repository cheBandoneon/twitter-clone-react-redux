# Twitter Clone
This is a really simplified version of a Twitter like site. 
It focuses on practicing React.js / Redux, so styling, security etc are put to second fate. 
It should support the main features like, post tweet, add hashtag, mention user, edit/delete tweet, login/register. Edit/delete tweet, login/register are not yet implemented.

# Launch Project Steps:

1. Create a mongoDB Database called twitter-clone and import the json files inside the folder mongoDBdata.
2. Start the server 
3. Run "npm run start" on terminal.
